# AutoCAD Plugin for Calculating Volumes of Structural Elements

This AutoCAD plugin provides a Windows Form interface to calculate the areas and volumes of various structural elements such as columns, beams, slabs, reinforced concrete (RC) footings, and plain concrete (PC) footings. The plugin allows users to input the layer names and element heights, then automatically computes the total volume of the selected elements based on their corresponding AutoCAD layers.

## Features

- **Calculate Column Volume**: Computes the volume of columns based on user input for layer name and column height.
- **Calculate Beam Volume**: Allows users to enter beam height and calculate the total volume of beams in a specific layer.
- **Calculate Slab Volume**: Computes the volume of slabs given their height and layer.
- **Calculate RC Footing Volume**: Calculates the volume of reinforced concrete footings with user-defined layer name and height.
- **Calculate PC Footing Volume**: Computes the volume of plain concrete footings with height and layer inputs.
- **AutoCAD Layer Integration**: Retrieves geometry from specific layers in the active AutoCAD drawing and performs volume calculations using the area and user-defined height.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and build the project in Visual Studio.
2. Load the plugin into AutoCAD.
3. Open the form, input the layer names and heights of the elements.
4. Press the corresponding button (e.g., `Calculate Volume`) for the element type you want to compute.
5. The calculated volume will be displayed in cubic meters (mÂ³) in the form.

## Prerequisites

- Autodesk AutoCAD 2021 or later.
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later.
- Visual Studio (for building and debugging the plugin).

## Installation

1. Build the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Load the `.dll` file generated by the build into AutoCAD using the `NETLOAD` command.
3. Run the plugin from within AutoCAD and begin using the form to calculate areas and volumes.

## Example

1. Enter the name of the layer containing your columns.
2. Input the height of the columns.
3. Click the "Calculate Volume" button.
4. The total volume of all columns in the specified layer will be calculated and displayed in cubic meters.
